Thank you for giving me the opportunity to show you, my skills. First of all, there is a nav bar at the top of the page which supports two links, one of them is called ListUser
that it displays a cart for each user with its details and there are two buttons on it, for deleting and updating the user, but nobody can delete, create or update a user until 
they sign up or if they already registered, they can sign in to create a new user or update and delete them, so both authentication and authorization are applied on this web page.

- Technology used: Redux, Mongo DB (CRUD), Node.js, Express
- A React.js form collecting first name, last name, and phone number, with a UI
framework called, material-ui

- It can display the name of user on the nav bar
- Now user can create a new user, delete and update it
- console demonstrates the data from MongoDB.

# For example, I edited a user which is called John Smith to John Brown, and it immediately changed.

# I tested the backend on Postman as well to make sure everything works perfectly, and you can see token is created for the user and it will expire after an hour.
