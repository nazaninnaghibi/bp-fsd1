Thank you for giving me the opportunity to show you my skills. First of all, there is a nav bar at the top of the page which supports two links, one of them is called ListUser
that it displays a cart for each user with its details and there are two buttons on it, for deleting and updating the user, but no body can delete, create or update a user until 
they sign up or if they already registered they can sign in to create a new user or update and delete them, so both authentication and authorization are applied on this web page.

Technology used: Redux, Mongo DB (CRUD), Node.js, Express

- It can display the name of user on the nav bar
- Now user can create a new user, delete and update it
- console demostrates the api's data from mongodb.
